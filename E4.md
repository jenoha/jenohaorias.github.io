My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
-Pending if the website uploaded correctly, I learned how to use arrays to display items and quantities available in a table. I also learned how to use forms to process information on a server. This allowed users to select and process multiple products/services, and have a server validate the data and provide feedback to the user.

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
-A bit more confidence in my work would be good. I found myself second-guessing myself often (mostly because there was a bit of freedom than in previous WOD's). I feel like with more practice I'd be able to do this with more ease. Either that, or study arrays and lines a bit more. I found myself relying on AI to help with organizing the code, and make sure it was generally correct. I also had a hard time uploading the site, which is why I gave the caveat to my improves that if my website loaded correctly, I'd have learned, and improved a lot. If not, then, oh well.

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
-Uh, well, yes and no. As the WOD's got more difficult, I required a bit more assistance that the screencasts provided. I gave my genuine attempts the first few tries, and used the videos to fill in the blanks. When they were removed, the WOD's took more time (which kinda helped with Assignment 1, but on the other hand not so much because there was info that I wasn't familiar with). I wanna say, I wish we didn't have to record our attempts at WOD's, although I understand the thought process as to why. Its one of the reasons that hindered me personally from finishing some of them on time because of the amount of time that it took to complete recordings.

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
-Going over the slides for Arrays and parameters helped a bit during assignment 1. The labs themselves lined up with the lectures which I found helpful. 

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
-I feel like Assignment 1 showed me how time consuming the work could be. It definitely took a lot longer than I had initially thought. I feel like if I delegated more prep-time, I could make Assignment 2 with more quality than Assignment 1. 

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
-Maybe remove having to record the WOD's. It affected my ability to focus on completing the actual assignments because I often had to reshoot either due to technical reasons and the environment I was in made it difficult to speak clearly. This took more time than having to figure out what I did wrong with the code, which became a recurring problem as I went on. To address this, I'd say have us do a write-up detailing what we could've done to improve, and how with each attempt, kinda like what we did with the labs but just applied a little differently. This way student are still held accountable, but its more felxible in terms of recording capability (eg: doing the assignments in the Hamilton computer lab).

What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
-I relied a lot on the WOD's, labs, and screencasts. I showed up to a info-session with the TA's a few times, and that helped fill in the blanks, along with the videos the professor made to address some of the issues that popped up. I wanna say that beyond that, delegating my own personal time was my flaw in this assignment, as I feel I could've done more. Aside from that, I genuinely did try, so I'm hoping that Assignment 2 goes a little better.
