Spaghetti is a simple dish. Every ingredient an instrument, each on their own a cacophany of experiences, but together it is a symphony of flavor. It is an orchestra that encapsulates countless individuals hearts and minds globally. Entire cultures adapt it to the ingredients they have locally, unifying them with a twirl of their individual forks. It is what many consider home. To me, it is one of the most important projects that I work to perfect every time I make it. That project is dinner.

Now I know what you're thinking. What is this paragraph? How does this apply to MIS? Did I really just read about spaghetti on a professional portfolio? If there is one thing that cooking has taught me, it is that you have to be audacious. Not just because I don't have an actual MIS project I'm presently working on. Although technically this was written on an ".md" file, and I am going to make spaghetti for dinner tonight so yes, it is an actual project and its related to MIS. Don't believe me? I included a recipe below:

```cpp
Ingredient List:
{
    1 box spaghetti noodles
    1 pound ground beef
    1 egg
    1/2 cup parsley
    1/2 cup basil
    1/2 cup grated parmesean
    2 cloves of garlic
    1-2 tablespoons of salt and pepper
    1 jar of spaghetti sauce
    1/2 cup of breadcrumbs
}
```
