BrowserHistory1 was difficult for me for a few reasons. Firstly, I didn't realize my microphone was muted until eight minutes in, and I did this just about three times pushing me back a while. I also had some issues with the table of contents because the Firefox and Chrome links weren't working correctly. It was only during BrowserHistory2 that I realized the `<a></a>` tags weren't placed correctly, so I made the adjustment. This took me about an hour in total, and four times to complete: my final submission was just under fifteen minutes. One key-takeaway from this was to pay more attention to detail, because little mistakes like the ones I made are avoidable.

BrowserHistory2 was much easier by comparison to BrowserHistory1. I sped through the .CSS file portion fairly quickly. Some main points that set me back were the brackets: `{}`, and how I got them mixed up with `[]` at some points. The spacing between the logos and the text caught my attention a bit, but I didn't know how to fix that at the time so I decided to move on. Everything came out pretty well, so all in all, not bad. I finished in under ten minutes, and it only took one time to complete. One key-takeaway was to not get caught up on little details, like the brackets.

BrowserHistory3 was a bit more challenging than BrowserHistory2. Upon my first completion, I had some issues with formatting the table of contents to match the image from the instructions. I did watch the video and managed to troubleshoot the problem, which was the `<div id="navbar">`, and its `ul` and `#navbar` counterparts in the style.CSS file (I completely forgot that was a thing). I would've gotten WOD3 done in two attempts, but I forgot to turn on my microphone again and my timer refused to work, bringing me to approximately three attempts. I finished in about eleven minutes, and got the page to look pretty similar to the sample. 

My advice is that you should make a genuine attempt at completing the WOD's first before relying on the videos. That's not to say that the videos/AI aren't incredibly helpful (because they are for code that you have a hard time remembering), but you retain more information if you make your attempt without them. That, and you feel like a champ when you finish it. You can avoid little mistakes, like forgetting to turn on your microphone, by slowing down a bit (I should've, but didn't because I was trying to make time). For the first three WOD's, I gotta say, not bad.
