Ever since I first touched a computer, I’ve always been eager to learn about what makes them work. As a human resources specialist for the last four years, I have had the opportunity to witness people grow and change and sometimes clash. In that profession, it is important to think thoughtfully and solve problems for both individuals and on computer programs, so the company can work effectively. It’s that understanding of cohesion between many functioning parts within a greater body that makes something as technical as management information systems interesting to me.

I knew that compatability between individuals was important in the workplace, but I never gave it any thought that the systems I was using required the same amount of nuance. Thus, learning about coding and the usage of different programs like VS Code and command prompts has been incredibly interesting to me. Understanding, managing, and implementing these systems are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. When I was working day to day, I never really questioned it. When I learned about MIS as a major, I felt like that opportunity to develop a greater understanding of these systems and how they worked had finally presented itself.

I am now starting to take an MIS class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, I remain eager to learn and grow.
