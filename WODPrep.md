The most recent WOD I submitted was "Invoice1". This detailed how to create a store receipt in Visual Studio Code. We created this in an HTML file, however, we also used elements of JavaScript. This was the longest WOD I have done, at around thirty-eight minutes, placing me somewhere between the Av and Sd brackets in the template. 

Going into the invoice, I was unfamiliar with much of the javascript expressions. Beginning and ending expressions with "/*" and "*/", and starting single statements with "//" slowed me down as I had never applied these concepts until this assignment. There was also a greater use of '${}' to expand strings: I was only used to using "()". It started slow, but the pace picked up as I filled out the remainder of the code according to the template.

Previous WOD's worked similarly in that I recorded myself fulfilling the requirements in the template, in a timely manner. Something I wish I did to prepare prior, was referring to the "Expressions, Precedence, and Working With Strings" slideshow in microsoft powerpoint more. This is so that I could waste less time trying to remember what expressions and format to write in Javascript. I also wish the slides mentioned that 'let' was block scoped, and 'var' was function scoped, and how to demonstrate them correctly when declaring variables. I did not use AI to help with this specific WOD, but I did refer to the video after my first attempt and I annotated where I went wrong so that I could see how to execute code correctly.

There were two main things I should have done to successfully complete "Invoice1" and future WOD's. The first is to refer more to the powerpoint slides. This would have helped mitigate little mistakes, such as the proper use of '${}' and "*/" and "/*". The second thing, is reference the video more. This WOD covered a lot of new information, including the use of "//" for beginning single statements, and "document.write()" within a <script>. I value figuring out new concepts on my own, however I believe that timed assignments, like WOD's, need to have a limit for this per question. This is so I can be more effective and timely.
